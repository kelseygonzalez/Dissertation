# Dissertation

This repository holds the source latex code for my dissertation work as a PhD student in Sociology at the University of
Arizona, synched to Overleaf. It fulfills all requirements for dissertations submitted to the Graduate College of the 
University of Arizona for a three article dissertation, not an option for the original latex template. This include 
having _individual_ reference sections for each appendix section.
