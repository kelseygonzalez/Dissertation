% I would like to thank many people for helping me to complete this research. First, I have to thank my survey interview participants for their participation. I learned so much from their stories..

% I have to thank my instructors and mentors who have helped me become a better researcher and
% sociologist, and social data scientist. From Trinity College, Dublin to the University of Arizona, 
% to my work today as a data scientist I have had strong mentors who challenged me to continually
% dive a little deeper and make sure my findings were rigorous and robust in order to  study the social world in a systemic manner. 

% I must thank my other half who has been there every step of the way. From every late night walk, 
% surprise donut, or last minute proofreading,  From every moment of self-doubt to immense celebration, you walked the path with me and rooted for me to keep going. I couldn't have done this without you.

% Finally, thank you to all others who have believed in my work and supported me along the way. 
% To those who have provided funding through fellowships and grants, like the Louise Foucar Marshall Foundation, University of Arizona Hispanic Alumni Club, the UArizona Social \& Behavioral Sciences Research Institute, The UArizona Data Science Instittue, the American Sociological Association Student Forum and the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science: thank you. To my fellow classmates, friends, and collaborators throughout my academic journey, you inspired me! To the University of Arizona Sociology 
% Faculty, staff 



% the unsung heroes who assisted me. I relied heavily on the UA
% sociology staff for guidance along the way, numerous instructors for distributing my rather
% unconventional survey in their classes, and institutional resources like the UA IRB and SBSRI. I
% could not have completed this project without all of this logistical support and financial support
% from the Graduate and Professional Student Council, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences,
% and Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute at the University of Arizona.
